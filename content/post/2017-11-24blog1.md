“Mom!  I want to be a champion rock climber!”  With those words, my then 5-year-old effectively shifted the axis on which our world turned.  It was the end of February 2017.   

Ming has always loved to climb.  At 14 months old, he began trying to puzzle out how to climb out of his crib.  By 18 months old, he managed it – one leg up and over the top rail, slowly controlled lowering of his body, step one foot onto the edge of the crib mattress through one of the slats, and gently set the other foot on the floor.  Et voila!  One very successful crib jailbreak, and one very happy toddler! 

By 2 years old, he had begun climbing trees.  He started with trees that had numerous low-lying branches that worked for his short stature.  I’d watch fascinated as he carefully tested out each foot and hand hold, slowly picking his way around the tree’s massive trunk branch by branch.  

By 3-4 years old, he could scale most any tree… and did.  He could shimmy himself up the trunk of a tree whose lowest branch was thrice his height!  Once in it, he could easily climb his way up and around.  Anytime Ming was missing from the playground, my friends and I were in the habit of automatically looking up, instead of around, to find him.  He’d inevitably be midway up one of the nearby trees, or perched on top of the play structure or swing set support.  It was around this time that well-meaning parents and kids would regularly track me down on the playground, frantically inquiring as to whether or not I was aware that my son was perched at some dizzying height and imploring me to immediately get him down.  It was also around this time that friends and neighbors were well accustomed to Ming’s climbing voracity, and began pointing us towards our local rock climbing gym – Rocky Top - for when the weather was too cold or too wet for him to climb and play outside.  

By 5 years old, he was in the habit of completely bypassing the intended entrances into play structures on the playground.  He’d simply scale the outside of the 2, sometimes 3, level structure and flip himself onto one of the landings.  And the monkey bars?!  Child’s play... literally! Ming would fly across them, sometimes crossing as many as 16 times back and forth before he’d set his feet down.  He began creating and mastering new challenges for himself, including skipping every other rung, skipping every 2-3 rungs, crossing them backwards, starting 4 rungs in after taking a flying leap off of the landing, and even flipping one-armed between each bar grab.  Ming had begun Kindergarten that August, and shortly thereafter, we were informed that his teachers had had to implement an entirely new set of rules for safe play on the playground during recess on his account!  

That brings us to February 2017.  We were climbing at our local rock climbing gym – Rocky Top – a few times a month around then, on account of the weather being cold.  At some point during one of our visits early on in the month, one of the staff members pulled me aside and excitedly explained that Ming has a unique gift.  He said he’d only seen professional climbers move on the wall as intuitively as Ming does.  I thought that was a super sweet compliment, so I smiled and thanked him and we went on our merry way not thinking any more of it.  Two weeks later, we ventured out to Richmond on a rainy day, as I had scored a Groupon deal for a top roping sampler package at Peak Experiences.  Lory, the staff member assigned to be on belay for Ming, chose a 5.6 route on a 30-foot wall that he thought would be a good starting point for Ming.  As he watched Ming sail up the route without a pause, Lory’s eyes grew progressively rounder and I distinctly remember his head snapping around towards me as he jokingly exclaimed “Can I keep him?!  He’s AMAZING!!”  Once down, Ming carefully began studying all of the various routes on the nearby walls, and Lory asked him which route was speaking to him.  After a little deliberation, Ming excitedly pointed to a 5.8 route on a 50-foot wall, and proceeded to scale it with relative ease until he reached a point near the very top that required an extension beyond his short wingspan.  At this point, Lory’s excitement about Ming’s climbing ability was infectious and he challenged him to flash a 5.7 route with some inversions on a 40-foot wall.  Lory had begun gathering a few others around to watch Ming climb as he shot straight up that route.  Once down, Lory enthusiastically exclaimed that he had never seen a child as young as Ming climb the way that he does.  He also remarked that Ming has a unique gift.  And low and behold, about a week later, Ming announced his intention to become a champion rock climber.
